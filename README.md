# Handwritten Digit Classifier using TensorFlow

This project implements a handwritten digit classifier based on the MNIST dataset using neural networks from TensorFlow. The classifier is built using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve high accuracy in recognizing handwritten digits.


## 📋 Introduction

The MNIST dataset is a large collection of handwritten digits commonly used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

## 🗃️ Dataset

MNIST set is a large collection of handwritten digits. It is a very popular dataset in the field of image processing. It is often used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

The data files train.csv and test.csv contain gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine.

Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.

The dataset used in this analysis can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data).
